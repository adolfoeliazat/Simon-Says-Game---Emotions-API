# Simon-Says-Game---Emotions-API
A very, very, very simple game using OpenCV and MS Emotion API  

I'm in a hurry, the game is still full of bugs, so check directly the IPython notebook for details:  
[Simon Says Emotions Game!](https://github.com/ricardodeazambuja/Simon-Says-Game---Emotions-API/blob/master/Simon%20Says%20Emotions%20Game.ipynb)


I started thinking about this game after reading this:
