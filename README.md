# Simon-Says-Game---Emotions-API
A very, very, very simple game using OpenCV, Python and MS Emotion API. The game will randomly pick an emotion each turn and the user(s) need to express that emotion (face) to get a high score!

I'm in a hurry, the game is still full of bugs, so check directly the IPython notebook for details:
