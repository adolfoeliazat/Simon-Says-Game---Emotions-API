# Simon-Says-Game---Emotions-API
A very, very, very simple game using [OpenCV](http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [MS Emotion API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/) (you will need an account, free, to use the game). The game will randomly pick an emotion each turn and the user(s) need to express that emotion (face) to get a high score!

I'm in a hurry, the game is still full of bugs, so check directly the IPython notebook for details:  
[Simon Says Emotions Game!](https://github.com/ricardodeazambuja/Simon-Says-Game---Emotions-API/blob/master/Simon%20Says%20Emotions%20Game.ipynb)  
  
If you don't have [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) installed, just copy and paste the code from the first two cells into a normal text file and run it using python command line.  

I started thinking about this game after reading this:
